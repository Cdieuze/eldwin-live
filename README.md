# Eldwin — Live Market Stress Indicator

Eldwin is a real-time market stress indicator designed to translate complex financial signals into a single, intuitive visual.

Instead of charts, dashboards, and noise, Eldwin provides one living signal that reflects the current market regime.

## What Eldwin Does

- Computes a proprietary market stress index (0–100)
- Uses real-time financial data (volatility, credit, equities, bonds)
- Updates automatically at configurable intervals
- Visualizes market conditions through a living orb
- Adapts its message and visuals as market stress evolves

## Why Eldwin

Markets generate massive amounts of information, but decision-making requires clarity.

Eldwin focuses on:
- Signal over noise
- Intuition over complexity
- Context over raw data

One indicator. One state of the market.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- NumPy / Pandas
- Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

## Status

This project is an experimental live MVP built for demonstration, research, and early validation.
